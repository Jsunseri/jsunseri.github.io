# Overview

Hey guys! Here's some suggested wedding music for your ceremony. For everywhere
except the prelude and postlude, just one piece should suffice (and we probably
won't even make it through most of that).

For sections where I've just suggested something I feel is quiet and pretty
(providing a meditative sonic background to something important happening,
which the music should complement but not overshadow), I've provided a
parenthetical note that music suggested in any of these sections could be
appropriate for any of the others. 

# Musical Prelude
You probably want 20-30 minutes of music to provide some background as guests
arrive. IMO this stuff can be more interesting/attention-getting than what's
used during the ceremony itself (where I have mostly suggested things that are
pretty and inobtrusive), but it should probably be more reflective and placid
than the more energetic things that can happen in the postlude. Around 4 or 5
pieces should do it; here are some suggestions:
### Adagio Cantabile from Sonata Pathetique - Beethoven
Danielle used to play this frequently, which is part of the reason I think
it would be especially nice as part of the prelude.

### Minuet from Partita No. 1 - J.S. Bach 
### Rustle of Spring - Sinding 
### Polish Dance - Scharwenka 
### Spring Song - Mendelssohn 
### Variations on the Kanon by Pachelbel 
### Claire de Lune - Debussy 
### Rydia - FFIV OST
### Tenderness in the Air - FFV OST
### Mystic Forest - FFIV OST

# Honorary Seating
### Angel Eyes - Jim Brickman 
(Or similar options from the other sections)

# Seating of Mothers
### Butterfly Waltz - Brian Cain 
### Sheep May Safely Graze - Bach 
### Comptine D’un Autre Ete - Yann Tiersen 
(Or similar options from the other sections)

# Processional
For everyone who enters before the bride; usually something happy and pretty
but lyrical and not as dramatic as what accompanies the bride's procession.
Examples:
### Canon in D - Pachelbel
### Jesu Joy of Man’s Desiring - Bach
### Ave Maria - Gounod

# Entrance of the Bride
Usually some kind of fanfare. Some suggestions:
### Fanfare Canon in D - Jennifer Cook 
### Largo - Handel 
### Trumpet Voluntary - Clarke 
### Trumpet Tune - Purcell 
### Trumpet Voluntary - Stanley 

# Unity Ceremony 
### Ave Maria - Schubert 
### River Flows in You - Yiruma 
(Or similar options from the other sections)

# The Lord’s Prayer 
The officiant noted there could be music here; I'm assuming they were
suggesting the prayer itself may be sung. I think I might have to defer to your
judgment for choosing whether it be sung, and if so, what version - in my
experience, Catholics usually "chant" this prayer, if they sing it at all, and
I'm not sure what the denominations of all your guests are. My feeling is it
might be safer to just recite this prayer, to ensure that people of different
denominations aren't stuck trying to sing a tune they don't know. If you want
me to play something here, that's fine too. 

# Recessional
Something jubilant. Here are some suggestions:
### Merry-Go - Round of Life 
### Hornpipe - Handel
### Allegro from Toccata in G Major - Bach 
### Wedding March - Mendelssohn 
### Polonaise Op. 40 No.1 - Chopin 

# Postlude
You'll probably want some music afterwards as people file out, to keep the mood
up. I think what happens here can be more fun, casual, and relaxed than what's
used elsewhere. If you're having a receiving line nearby, I'd probably just
keep playing while that's going on. Here are some ideas, but really anything
not selected in the previous sectiosn could go here, as well as many other
things. 
### Musetta’s Waltz - Puccini 
### How Great Thou Art
### Fly Me To the Moon 
### It Had to Be You 
### Over the Rainbow 
### The Prayer 
### The Rose
